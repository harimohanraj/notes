- The effects of the industry are powerful and comprehensive and it bleeds heavily into the kind of work that we do, the tools that are available for us to use, the mindshare being spent on expanding, growing, and solidifying the use of those tools ... it's mind-boggling.
- There's a famous quote along the lines of - "I've seen the best minds of my generation spending their time on optimizing ad clicks" - and it's true! A ton of research and engineering going into this. But beyond that, a ton of effort going into optimizing technology and structures around the gravity that this ecosystem creates.
  - Larger memory, more cores, incredibly powerful computers ... to run behemoth web browsers, code editors. And it doesn't feel like these things are getting any *better* - rather, worse and more complected. 
- Why don't we have a modern Hyperdeck? But wait, there's someone who has created this incredible thing - https://beyondloom.com/decker.
  - It's not because these things aren't suitable for modern day back-office work - that kind of stuff was being done by Lotus 123, being done in the 90s effectively with way less computing resources, without the cloud.
  - People talk very fondly about how productive they were with Visual BASIC, Delphi, etc.
  - People are incredibly productive with Excel, for all its faults.
- Gamefreak has barely innovated on the Pokemon franchise, and now people are freaking out about Palworld, which has a ton of the elements that people have loved from both the old and new Pokemon games, and is relatively shameless about its inspiration ... but was made by a tiny team who just wanted to make something good?
- The problem is that the promise is often - we're making this thing better for you. But the yous become more numerous, because the beast must be fed, and this thing becomes a little worse for everyone as time goes on. We think that enshittification can only happen to *products*, but I think this is a viral property that's infected the substrate of the products itself.
  - The tools we use aren't immune to this! They are products too, in the end.
- There should be this concept of minimum viable team size to construct, operate, maintain, and repair technologies.
  - But there isn't, which leads to whole teams spawning to handle these things.
  - But isn't that directly contradictory to the point of technology? Scaling exponentially, super-linearly, without consuming additional resources.     
  - But it also then leads to products for people who are aware that spinning up entire organizational structures is untenable - platforms that "manage" these behemoth technologies for you.
