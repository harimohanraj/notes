- CPU Core: hardware concept, can have multiple parallel program executions
- Hyperthreading / Virtual Cores: hardware-level virtual cores, still parallel (but with caveats)
- OS Processes: operating system concept, multiple parallel program executions that share memory
- OS Threads: operating system concept, concurrent executions that do not necessarily share memory
- Green Threads / Language-level Threads: language concept, mapping many virtual threads to OS threads or processes
